            We are Arba Minch University Electrical and computer engineering students coming together to create an innovative rental assistant web app. This collaborative project was a good way to apply our technical skills and creativity to address real-world challenges in the rental market. In this web app we have a user-friendly platform that simplifies the process renting and selling for both landlords and tenants, from listing properties to managing rental agreements through messaging. This hands-on experience not only enhances our programming and problem-solving abilities but also fosters a sense of community and purpose, as we aim to make a positive impact in our local housing landscape.
